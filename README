lowfetch
--------
A system info tool I made to learn C

GOALS:
* Few lines of code (<500) while having readable code
* Few/no runtime dependencies

IN PROGRESS:
* Modularize code

TODO:
* (null)

(default) COMPILATION REQUIREMENTS:
* GNU Make
* A C compiler (CC=clang by default)
* Mold linker (CFLAGS=-std=c99 -fuse-ld=mold -Wall -O3)
command: make build

NOTES:
* There is no planned support for non-Linux operating systems

ASSUMPTIONS:
    Assumptions this programs makes. Feel free to make an issue if it breaks on Linux.
* You use a Linux-based OS
* /etc/os-release exists
* The first line in /etc/os-release is NAME="Distro Name"
* /proc/version exists
* /proc/uptime exists
* Either $HOME or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME are defined
* Either $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP or $XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP are defined
* $SHELL is defined
* You have a package manager (dpkg, dnf, xpbs or pacman) - support for more may be added
