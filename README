A system info tool I made to learn C

GOALS:
* Use C89[1]
* Few lines of code (<500) while having readable code
* Few/no runtime dependencies

TODO:
* Add distro name
* Add more color options
* ...

(default) COMPILATION REQUIREMENTS:
* GNU Make
* A C compiler (CC=clang by default)
* Mold linker (CFLAGS=-std=c89 -fuse-ld=mold -Wall)
command: make build

NOTES:
*[1] c99 or later may be used in the future, but only if necessary
* There is no planned support for non-Linux operating systems
