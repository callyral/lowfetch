lowfetch
--------
A system info tool I made to learn C

GOALS:
* Few lines of code (<500) while having readable code
* Few/no runtime dependencies

IN PROGRESS:
* Make distro name prettier

TODO:
* Re-add option to shorten kernel name
-- It was removed due to unknown buggy behaviour

(default) COMPILATION REQUIREMENTS:
* GNU Make
* A C compiler (CC=clang by default)
* Mold linker (CFLAGS=-std=c99 -fuse-ld=mold -Wall -O3)
command: make build

NOTES:
* There is no planned support for non-Linux operating systems
